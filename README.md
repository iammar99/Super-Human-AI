## What is Super Human AI


The Super Human AI Agent is an intelligent application designed to streamline the job application process. It takes your CV, applies to multiple jobs on LinkedIn, and provides a summary of the actions taken.


## How does it work ?


1. **User Input**: The user uploads their CV to the platform.
2. **Data Extraction**: The AI extracts relevant information from the CV, such as education, work experience, and skills.
3. **Job Search**: The agent searches for job postings on LinkedIn that match the user’s qualifications.
4. **Application Submission**: It applies to the selected job postings on behalf of the user.
5. **Results Summary**: Finally, the AI generates a summary of the jobs applied for and shares it with the user.



## Why is it needed ?


In today's competitive job market, finding the right job can be a daunting and time-consuming task. The Super Human AI Agent addresses several key challenges faced by job seekers:

### 1. **Time-Consuming Process**
Applying for jobs manually can take hours, especially for those who want to apply to multiple positions. The AI agent automates this process, allowing users to focus on preparing for interviews and enhancing their skills rather than spending countless hours on job applications.

### 2. **Matching Skills with Opportunities**
Many job seekers struggle to find positions that align with their skills and experiences. The AI agent analyzes the user's CV and searches for relevant job postings on LinkedIn, ensuring that applicants are matched with roles that fit their qualifications.

### 3. **Increased Job Application Reach**
Applying to jobs is often limited to a few opportunities. With the AI agent, users can apply to multiple job listings simultaneously, increasing their chances of landing interviews and job offers.

### 4. **Summarized Actions for Better Tracking**
Keeping track of job applications can be challenging. The AI agent provides a summary report detailing which jobs have been applied for, helping users stay organized and informed about their job search progress.

### 5. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**
Not everyone has the same level of access to job search resources or knowledge about applying effectively. The Super Human AI Agent democratizes the job application process by making it easier and more accessible for everyone, regardless of their background or experience.

### Conclusion
The Super Human AI Agent not only streamlines the job application process but also empowers job seekers by providing them with tools to navigate the job market effectively. By leveraging technology, it aims to enhance the job search experience and increase opportunities for success.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
